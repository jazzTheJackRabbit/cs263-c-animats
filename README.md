Abstract
=======
Learning strategies to avoid predators in a dynamic environment is quintessential for the survival of prey. Similarly, learning optimal hunting strategies is important for the survival of predators. In our project, we model the dynamics of a complex predatorÂ­prey environment to learn and appreciate the mechanisms of hunting and predator avoidance in predators and prey, respectively. We also introduce prey offsprings into the system and induce positive feedback in adult prey for protecting these offsprings. The adult prey eventually learn how to protect child prey in the presence of predators. In addition, since exploring the environment individually has a higher risk of being hunted, we hope to have the prey learn and prefer group exploration strategies as opposed to individual/lone exploration. We achieve these goals by providing reinforcement signals for every action our animats take in the dynamic environment.
